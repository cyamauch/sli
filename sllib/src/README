                                Version 1.4.6

                                                                  Aug. 15, 2021

- What is SLLIB?

  SLLIB appends APIs like script-languages (e.g., Python, IDL, PHP, etc.) to
  C-language, and minimizes your efforts on daily programming.

  + Stream
    Various streams (standard stream, compressed stream, network, etc.) can be
    handled by using the same APIs.  APIs for endian conversion are provided.

  + String, Array and Associative array
    SLLIB frees you from memory management to handle string, array and
    associative array.  There are many intelligent and well-chosen APIs
    including POSIX regular expression.

  + Multidimensional array
    You can handle multidimensional array like IDL.
    Mathematical operators (e.g., +, -, *, /, etc.) and expression including
    ':' and '*' (e.g. "0:99,*", etc.) can be used against array objects,
    and mathematical functions for both scalar and array are provided.  APIs
    for imaging data are also supported.  Functions for statistics of mdarray 
    objects are added in version 1.4.0.
    Using Intel/AMD CPUs enables enhancements of SIMD instructions in SLLIB.


- Requirements

  + OS
    Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX, Solaris or Cygwin.  Both 32-bit and 64-bit.

  + Compiler
    GCC g++ 3.3.2 or later,  Intel(R) C++ Compiler 11.1 or later.
    GCC g++ 4.x is required to enable enhancements using SIMD instructions.

  + Libraries
    zlib, bzip2, ncurses, and readline

  + Multi-threaded compression utilities (optional)
    digeststreamio class automatically detects following programs and calls
    them to perform very fast compression on the local disk:
     pigz:   http://www.zlib.net/pigz/
     lbzip2: http://lacos.hu/
