- What is SFITSIO?

  SFITSIO is a new library written from full scratch.  The concept is to
  provide script-like APIs which minimize programmer's efforts for FITS I/O.
  It enables you to write intuitively your codes for FITS.  SFITSIO will free
  you from looking through the manuals when writing codes for FITS I/O.


- Requirements

  + OS
    Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX, Solaris or Cygwin.  Both 32-bit and 64-bit.

  + Compiler
    GCC g++ 3.3.2 or later,  Intel(R) C++ Compiler 11.1 or later.
    GCC g++ 4.x is required to enable enhancements using SIMD instructions.

    You can download SLLIB from http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/~cyamauch/sli/.

  + Multi-threaded compression utilities (optional)

    very fast compression on the local disk:
